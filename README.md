# Chance-of-Admit-Prediction-Linear-Regression
Chance of admit prediction using linear regression
In this project we're going to use information like a student's gpa, gre, toefl, university ranking, etc. to predict the chance of admit. This kind of model is useful for graduate and undergraduate students. The dataset for this problem is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions/download.

We will create a model with the following steps:

Download and explore the dataset
Prepare the dataset for training
Create a linear regression model
Train the model to fit the data
Make predictions using the trained model
